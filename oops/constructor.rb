# In above class we have 2 member_fields @name and @university
# name and university are the parameter, whose values will be set when object is instantiated
# @name and @university are called instance variables
# get_name is a instance method which is returning member field i.e. name passed at the time of object creation
# In Ruby instance variables are accessible only via methods, because IVs are private by default, that’s why we can’t get them directly.
# The values of name and university are stored inside instance variables that are unique to each object.
